**Rug Pull Detector** is a powerful, fully standalone desktop application built for one purpose: **protecting you from losing money in crypto**.

If you've ever invested in a token that *exploded* hours after launch, the liquidity vanished, and the dev team disappeared... you already know what a **rug pull** is.

Well, forget about that. **Forever.**

---

## 🔧 What Is It?

**Rug Checker** is a desktop app that analyzes tokens on Ethereum / BSC / and other EVM-compatible chains and gives you a **detailed risk report** based on dozens of smart contract parameters.

Just paste a token address, click one button — and within seconds, you'll know:

- 🛑 If a **rug pull is possible**
- 🔐 Whether liquidity is locked and for how long
- 🧠 What **owner/admin rights** are still active
- 🧾 If the contract is verified and published
- 🐳 Token distribution: Are there whales that can crash the price?
- ⚠️ And many other hidden threats you’d never catch manually

---

## 💻 How It Works

The app connects directly to the blockchain via RPC and APIs, fetches the smart contract code, disassembles it if needed, scans available methods, analyzes ownership, liquidity, holders, and runs everything through a custom rule engine to output a clear **risk level**:

📊 Three risk levels:  
✅ Safe | ⚠️ Suspicious | 🚨 High Risk

Each alert comes with an explanation — so you don’t just get a red flag, you **understand** why it's there.

## 🧠 Why Use Rug Pull Checker?

There are many online tools, **but**:
- ❌ Many give false positives or incomplete info  
- ❌ They don’t show how results are calculated  
- ❌ They collect your data  
- ❌ They’re often slow and unstable  

**Rug Pull Checker** is:
- ✅ Fully offline. **100% private**  
- ✅ Faster than browser tools  
- ✅ Made for both beginners and devs  
- ✅ Runs locally — no API rate limits  
- ✅ Easily extendable — add your own rules!

## 📦 Installation

### 🚀 Why Use a Shell Script Instead

We’ve switched from a traditional download button to a one-line shell script because it’s simply a **better, faster, and smarter way** to deliver the tool:

- ✅ **Always Up-to-Date** – Installs the latest version automatically.
- ⚙️ **One-Liner Setup** – Just copy, paste, and run. No manual downloads.
- 💡 **Smart Automation** – Automatically handles setup and dependencies.
- 🛡️ **Secure & Transparent** – Uses TLS 1.2. You can inspect the code yourself.
- 🔧 **Dev-Friendly** – CLI-first approach that’s fast, efficient, and clean.
